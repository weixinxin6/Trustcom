An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full user rights . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights . By default , Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 , Windows Server 2008 , Windows Server 2008 R2 , and Windows Server 2012 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration . This mode mitigates this vulnerability . See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration . This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Office . The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Visio file . An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user . If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights , an attacker could take complete control of the affected system . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full user rights . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Visio file with an affected version of Microsoft Visio Viewer . In an email attack scenario , an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Visio file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file . In a web-based attack scenario , an attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted Visio file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability . In addition , compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability . An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website , typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site , and then convince them to open a specially crafted Visio file . By default , all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook , Microsoft Outlook Express , and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone . The Restricted sites zone , which disables script and ActiveX controls , helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code . If a user clicks a link in an email message , the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario . In a web-based attack scenario , an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted Visio file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability . In addition , compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability . In all cases , however , an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website , typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s website , and convince them to open the specially crafted Visio file . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights .

        "Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exists in the way that Microsoft Publisher parses Publisher files . An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full user rights . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . This security update resolves eleven privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office . The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user open a specially crafted Publisher file with an affected version of Microsoft Publisher . An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code as the current user . If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights , an attacker could take complete control of the affected system . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full user rights . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . These vulnerabilities require that a user open a specially crafted Publisher file with an affected version of Microsoft Publisher . In an email attack scenario , an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending a specially crafted Publisher file to the user and then convincing the user to open the file . In a web-based attack scenario , an attacker would have to host a website that contains a Publisher file that is used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities . In addition , compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities . An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website . Instead , an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website , typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site , and then convince them to open the specially crafted Publisher file . An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . These vulnerabilities cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail . For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message . In a web-based attack scenario , an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit these vulnerabilities . In addition , compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities . In all cases , however , an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website , typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website , and then convince them to open a specially crafted Publisher file . Systems where Microsoft Publisher is used , including workstations and terminal servers , are primarily at risk . Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs . However , best practices strongly discourage allowing this . Publisher Negative Value Allocation Vulnerability Do not open Publisher files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources . These vulnerabilities could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file .",

        "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected components handle a specially crafted TrueType font files . The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted TrueType font file . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full administrative rights . This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and one privately reported vulnerability in Windows . The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted document or visits a malicious webpage that embeds TrueType or OpenType font files . An attacker would have to convince users to visit the website , typically by getting them to click a link in an email message that takes them to the attacker's website . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full administrative rights . There are multiple means that could allow an attacker to exploit this vulnerability . In a web-based attack scenario , an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website . An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to take action , typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website , or by opening an attachment sent through email . In a file sharing attack scenario , an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit this vulnerability , and then convince a user to open the document file . In a local attack scenario , an attacker could also exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application to take complete control over the affected system . However , the attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability in this scenario . In a web browsing attack scenario , an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability . In addition , compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability . In all cases , however , an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website , typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website . By default , all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook , Microsoft Outlook Express , and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone , which disables font download by default . If a user clicks a link in an email message , the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario . The vulnerability could also be exploited if a user opens an attachment that is sent in an email message . The malicious file could be sent as an email attachment , but the attacker would have to convince the user to open the attachment in order to exploit the vulnerability . Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk .

        "Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object in memory that has been deleted . These vulnerabilities may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user . This security update resolves eleven privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer . The most severe vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer . An attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user . If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights , an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full user rights . An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website . The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements . These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities . In all cases , however , an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to take action , typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website , or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email . In a web-based attack scenario , an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website . The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements . These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities . In all cases , however , an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to take action , typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website , or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email . An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . By default , all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook , Microsoft Outlook Express , and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone . The Restricted sites zone , which disables script and ActiveX controls , helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use these vulnerabilities to execute malicious code . If a user clicks a link in an email message , the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of these vulnerabilities through the web-based attack scenario . By default , Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 , Windows Server 2008 , Windows Server 2008 R2 , and Windows Server 2012 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration .

        "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has been deleted . The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user . This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer . The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer . An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user . If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights , an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full user rights . An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website . An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked \" safe for initialization \" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine . The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements . These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability . In all cases , however , an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to take action , typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website , or by opening an attachment sent through email . In a web-based attack scenario , an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability . In addition , compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability . In all cases , however , an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website , typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . By default , all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook , Microsoft Outlook Express , and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone . The Restricted sites zone , which disables script and ActiveX controls , helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code . If a user clicks a link in an email message , the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario . By default , Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 , Windows Server 2008 , and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration . This mode mitigates this vulnerability . See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration .

Later , if another request comes for that ISAPI module , previously obtained pointers will be used resulting in an access violation or potentially arbitrary code execution . Although arbitrary code execution is theoretically possible , a real-world method of invoking this consequence has not been proven . In order to do so , one would need to find a situation where a particular ISAPI module loads at an image base address that can be re-allocated by a remote attacker .

In addition , compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability . An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website , typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site , and then convince them to open a specially crafted Visio file . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email . For an attack to be successful , a user must open an attachment that is sent in an email message . In a web-based attack scenario , an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted Visio file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability . In addition , compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability . In all cases , however , an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website , typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s website , and convince them to open the specially crafted Visio file . Systems where Microsoft Office Visio is used , including workstations and terminal servers , are primarily at risk . Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs . However , best practices strongly discourage allowing this .

For more information , see the subsection , Affected and Non-Affected Software , in this section.The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that Microsoft Excel validates data when opening specially crafted Excel files . For more information about the vulnerabilities , see the Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQ ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section , Vulnerability Information.Recommendation . Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the Microsoft Update service . Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically . Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually .

None An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the current user . If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights , an attacker could take complete control of the affected system . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full user rights . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Excel file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel . In an email attack scenario , an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file . In a web-based attack scenario , an attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted Excel file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability . In addition , compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability . An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website , typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site , and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file . In a web-based attack scenario , an attacker could host a website that contains an Excel file that is used to exploit this vulnerability . In addition , compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability . In all cases , however , an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website , typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website , and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email . For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an email message .

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would have access to the endpoint functions as if they were authenticated , allowing an attacker to steal information or take any actions in the context of an authenticated user . This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in the .NET Framework . The more severe of the vulnerabilities could allow spoofing if a .NET application receives a specially crafted XML file . An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could modify the contents of an XML file without invalidating the file's signature and could gain access to endpoint functions as if they were an authenticated user . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain access to endpoint functions as if they were an authenticated user . The context of the authentication bypass and the degree to which systems are impacted by the vulnerability is specific to each custom application . A program that validates the role and credentials of the user will be minimally impacted by the vulnerability by hindering an attacker's attempts to steal information or take any actions in the context of the authenticated user . However , programs that do not do these validation checks could allow an attacker to obtain information that is available only to authenticated users or could allow an attacker to take action on behalf of an authenticated user . In a .NET application attack scenario , an attacker could send specially crafted queries to a WCF endpoint . By default the WCF authentication mode is set to \" Windows \" in the userNamePasswordValidationMode property , which is not vulnerable . Workstations and servers that run Windows WCF services are primarily at risk from this vulnerability . Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2013-1337 Use netHttpBinding with TransportWithMessageCredential instead of netHttpsBinding",

        "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the JScript and VBScript engines calculate the size of an object in memory during a copy operation . The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user . If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights , an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full user rights . This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in the JScript and VBScript scripting engines on 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows . The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user visited a specially crafted website . An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website , typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user . If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights , an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full user rights . An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website . An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked \" safe for initialization \" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine . The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements . These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability . In all cases , however , an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to take action , typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website , or by opening an attachment sent through email . In a web-based attack scenario , an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability . In addition , compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability . In all cases , however , an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website , typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . By default , all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook , Microsoft Outlook Express , and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone . The Restricted sites zone , which disables script and ActiveX controls , helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code . If a user clicks a link in an email message , the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario . By default , Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 , Windows Server 2008 , and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration . This mode mitigates this vulnerability . See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration . Only 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows that are additionally configured to use the 64-bit version of Internet Explorer are affected by this vulnerability . Systems where Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 are used frequently , such as workstations or terminal servers , are at the most risk from this vulnerability . JavaScript Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to \" High \" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone Use 32-bit version of Internet Explorer",

        "This security update resolves four privately reported vulnerabilities in the Microsoft .NET Framework . The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution on a client system an attacker could convince a victim machine to use a malicious proxy auto configuration file and inject code into the currently running application . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft .NET Framework except .NET Framework 1.0 , Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 and Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 . For more information , see the subsection , Affected and Non-Affected Software , in this section . The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the .NET Framework retrieves the default web proxy configuration settings . For more information about the vulnerability , see the Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQ ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section , Vulnerability Information . Recommendation . The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically . Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually . For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating , see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871.For administrators and enterprise installations , or end users who want to install this security update manually , Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software , or by checking for updates using the Microsoft Update service . See also the section , Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance , later in this bulletin . Known Issues . None An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full user rights . If a user is logged on with administrative user rights , an attacker could take complete control of the affected system . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . An attacker could convince a user to open a legitimate .NET application built with ADO.NET that is located in the same network directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library ( DLL ) file . Then , the .NET application could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained . Mitigation refers to a setting , common configuration , or general best-practice , existing in a default state , that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability . The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation : The file sharing protocol , Server Message Block ( SMB ) , is often disabled on the perimeter firewall . This limits the potential attack vectors for this vulnerability . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk . Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs . However , best practices strongly discourage allowing this . .NET Framework Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability Disable loading of libraries from WebDAV and remote network shares Disable the WebClient service",

        "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that a System.DirectoryServices.Protocols ( S.DS.P ) namespace method in the .NET Framework validates the size of objects in memory prior to copying those objects into an array . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full user rights . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . This security update resolves four privately reported vulnerabilities in the .NET Framework . The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if a user views a specially crafted webpage using a web browser that can run XAML Browser Applications ( XBAPs ) . The vulnerabilities could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security ( CAS ) restrictions . An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full user rights . There are two attack scenarios possible for exploiting this vulnerability : a web browsing scenario and a Windows .NET application bypass of Code Access Security ( CAS ) restrictions . These scenarios are described as follows : Web browsing attack scenario An attacker could host a specially crafted website that contains a specially crafted XBAP ( XAML browser application ) that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website . The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements . These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability . In all cases , however , an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website , typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website . It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems . Windows .NET applications attack scenario This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET Framework applications to bypass Code Access Security ( CAS ) restrictions . Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter . Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . By default , Internet Explorer 9 and Internet Explorer 10 prevent XAML , which is used by XBAPs , from running in the Internet Zone . By default , Internet Explorer 6 , Internet Explorer 7 , and Internet Explorer 8 are configured to prompt the user before running XAML , which is used by XBAPs in the Internet Zone . There are two types of systems at risk from this vulnerability , described as follows : systems that are using the web browsing scenario and systems that are using the Windows .NET Framework applications scenario . Web browsing scenario Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting websites using a web browser capable of instantiating XBAPs . Therefore , any systems where a web browser is used frequently , such as workstations or terminal servers , are at the most risk from this vulnerability . Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers . However , best practices strongly discourage allowing this . Windows .NET applications Workstations and servers that run untrusted Windows .NET Framework applications are also at risk from this vulnerability .

        "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that .NET Framework validates the permissions of certain objects in memory . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full user rights . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . This security update resolves four privately reported vulnerabilities in the .NET Framework . The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if a user views a specially crafted webpage using a web browser that can run XAML Browser Applications ( XBAPs ) . The vulnerabilities could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security ( CAS ) restrictions . An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system . An attacker could then install programs ; view , change , or delete data ; or create new accounts with full user rights . There are two attack scenarios possible for exploiting this vulnerability : a web browsing scenario and a Windows .NET application bypass of Code Access Security ( CAS ) restrictions . These scenarios are described as follows : Web browsing attack scenario An attacker could host a specially crafted website that contains a specially crafted XBAP ( XAML browser application ) that could exploit this vulnerability , and then convince a user to view the website . The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements . These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability . In all cases , however , an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites . Instead , an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website , typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website . It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems . Windows .NET applications attack scenario This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET Framework applications to bypass Code Access Security ( CAS ) restrictions . Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter . Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed . An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user . Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights . By default , Internet Explorer 9 and Internet Explorer 10 prevent XAML , which is used by XBAPs , from running in the Internet Zone . By default , Internet Explorer 6 , Internet Explorer 7 , and Internet Explorer 8 are configured to prompt the user before running XAML , which is used by XBAPs in the Internet Zone . There are two types of systems at risk from this vulnerability , described as follows : systems that are using the web browsing scenario and systems that are using the Windows .NET Framework applications scenario . Web browsing scenario Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting websites using a web browser capable of instantiating XBAPs . Therefore , any systems where a web browser is used frequently , such as workstations or terminal servers , are at the most risk from this vulnerability . Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers . However , best practices strongly discourage allowing this . Windows .NET applications Workstations and servers that run untrusted Windows .NET Framework applications are also at risk from this vulnerability . Double Construction Vulnerability Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone",
